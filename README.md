# Dealership Management System

This is a Dealership management system that is designed to manage the vehicle inventory and facilitates user interaction with a dealership's database 
of cars. This managment system allows users to perform various operations which look for vehicles based on different criteria, and adds new vehicles to 
the inventory, and removes the existing ones.

## Features
It has a search function where users can search for vehicles using a specified price range, make and model, by year range, color, mileage range and 
vehicle type.
This also has the feature of adding and removing existing vehicles in this program. 
The last notable feature that this has is that this program stores dealership and vehicle info into text files which allows data to persist between
multiple sessions of the same users.
